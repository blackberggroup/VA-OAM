                            </div>

                                <p>The Office of Advanced Manufacturing (OAM) and Central Virginia VA Health Care System (CVHCS) unveiled its new advanced manufacturing lab in Richmond on January 24, 2024. This newly renovated facility enhances OAM's ability to continue advancing Veteran health care solutions nationwide through improved 3D-printing and other advanced manufacturing technologies support.</p>

                                <p>CVHCS has been one of VAâ€™s flagship medical centers for decades and serves more than 77,500 Veterans annually throughout the region and across the Nation.</p>
                                
                                <p>The expansion of 3D printers at the Richmond OAM lab enables the creation of more specialized products on a larger scale, which is a significant step forward for Veteran health care.</p>
                                
                                <p>"Our lab is a fully functional, state-of-the-art facility where our team can create their innovations in the field of rehabilitation technology. We wanted [attendees] to see how excited we are about helping Veterans and how dedicated we are to doing it right," states Melissa Oliver, Occupational Therapist and AT Program Director for the Richmond VA Medical Center.</p>
                                
                                <p>The Richmond advanced manufacturing (AM) team has a long history with 3D printing technology, as they have used it since 2010 before the formation of OAM.</p>
                                
                                <p>The previous lab was also instrumental in producing personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, which underscored its adaptability, responsiveness to critical needs, and the crucial role AM can play in VA health care.</p>
                                
                                <p>"It's impressive to see the Richmond Medical Center's commitment to advancing health care for Veterans through the Richmond OAM lab. This dedication showcases VA's adaptability and commitment to serving Veterans," states Brian Burkhardt, Richmond OAM Site Lead.</p>
                                
                                <p>This event consisted of a lab space tour and a presentation by OAM leadership. Guests toured both floors currently used for advanced manufacturing design and development. Guests also saw tangible examples of the advanced technology used to help Veterans and heard from team members stationed around the lab who answered operations questions.</p>
